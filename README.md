Featured on devCodeCamp.com. Week 11-12 project assignment. Built in ASP.NET using the MVC model and the nopCommerce platform. The customer side handles online shopping, while the admin side monitors external dropshipping inventories and manages sales data. Prior to going to devCodeCamp, I was in the process of starting an online dropshipping store, but soon realized I didn't have the technical knowledge to build the site and features the way I wanted and needed to. This became a major catalyst behind my decision to go to coding school. It all came full circle when I was finally able to create what I had only dreamed of before.
